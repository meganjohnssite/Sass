        <h2>Road trip, anyone?</h2>
        <p>For the past few days, I've been vacationing in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. Here's a list of a few things I've done the past few days:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking Wine and taking in the scenic views</li>
            <li>Hiking in Great Smoky Mountain National Park</li>
            <li>Napping! Why can't every day include a nap?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>So What's Next?</h2>
        <p> One of my favorite things to do on vacation is plan another vacation...it's half the reason we work so hard, right? Well lucky for me I don't have to wait too long. Here is our plan for next month:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Badlands National Park - near Rapid City, SD</li>
            <li>Glacier National Park and Big Sky, Montana</li>
            <li>Yellowstone National Park and Jackson Hole, Wyoming</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="Section3">
        <p>Well, I guess it's time to hit the road and head back to NWA. Until next time!</p>
